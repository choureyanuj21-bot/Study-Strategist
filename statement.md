Problem Statement : The goal is to create an engaging and immersive interactive fiction experience that can be run directly from the command line/console. Traditional video games require complex graphics and interfaces, which can distract from narrative and core programming logic. This project addresses the need for a simple, accessible, text-based interactive environment where users can practice problem-solving skills and experience a story through structured textual input and output.

Scope of the project :
1. CLI Functionality: The application will operate exclusively through the Command Line Interface (CLI).


2. Core CRUD Operations: The project will implement the full ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete assignment records (CRUD operations).


3. Data Persistence: Assignment data will be stored and retrieved using a local CSV file  (or plain text file), allowing data to persist between sessions.

4. Key Reporting Modules: The project includes two main reporting features: comprehensive list viewing and specialized filtering by course/status, as well as the Priority View (assignments due in 7 days).

5. Basic Error Handling: Input validation will be implemented for critical fields (e.g., date format, numeric scores) to ensure system stability.

Target Users :
The Study Strategist is primarily designed for the following audience:

1. University and College Students: Students managing a heavy workload across multiple courses are the primary beneficiaries, as they need a centralized tool to track diverse assignments, projects, and exams.

2. Students in Introductory Programming Courses: The application is also ideal for users familiar with the command-line interface and basic file management, making it accessible to those who might be hesitant to use complex, graphical software.

High Level Features include :
1. Comprehensive Assignment Management (CRUD): The system provides full functionality to Add, Update (status and score), and Delete assignment records, ensuring complete control over the student's workload data.


2. Advanced Filtering and Reporting: The application includes tools to filter assignments by course or status and generates crucial reports, including a Priority View highlighting tasks due within the next seven days, to aid in strategic planning.


3. Data Persistence and System Reliability: Assignment data is securely saved to a local file and loaded upon startup, providing data persistence across sessions. The system is further supported by basic error handling to ensure smooth operation.
