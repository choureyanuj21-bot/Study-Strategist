VITyarthi Project for CSE (Student Assignment Tracker)

Project Title : Student Assignment Tracker

Project Overview : The Study Strategist is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help students efficiently manage and prioritize their academic workload. Built using Python, this utility solves the problem of scattered assignment information by providing a centralized platform for tracking deadlines, submission statuses and final scores across multiple courses. This application emphasises core Python Progamming Concepts like Data Structures, File I/O and Modular Design.
Key Goals : 1. To demonstrate the application of fundamentaal Python Programming concepts ina real-world educational problem.
2. To utilie features like priority view to help students manage upcoming deadlines.
3. To provide a cleaar, user-friendly interface for assignment input and reporting.

Project Features:
1. Assignment Data Management (CRUD) : This module allows users to have full control  over their assignment records. For Eg : Add Assignment, Update Status and Score and Delete Record
2. Reporting and Filtering : This module provides customized views to analyze and track the workload through Comprehensive View, Filtered View and Summary Report.
3. Priority and Persistence : This module ensures data security and helps students prioritize their work using Priority View, Data Persistence (Save/Load) and Input Validation.

Technologies/Tools Used : 1. Programming Language - Python 3.x
                          2. Libaries - csv, datetime and os
                          3. Version Control - Git
                          4. Project Hosting - Github
                          5. Development Environment - Command Line Interface (CLI)
                          

Steps to Install and Run the Project

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Use the git clone command to download the project files to your local machine

Step 2: Install Dependencies (Optional but Recommended)
1. Create a Virtual Environment
2. Activate the Environment
3. Install Requirements

Step 3: Run the Application
1. Ensure you are still inside the main project directory and your virtual environment is active (if you created one).
2. Execute the main application file (assuming you named it main_app.py during modularization).
3. The Student Assignment Tracker menu will appear, and you can begin adding and managing your assignments.

Instructions for Testing 
1. Setup and Environment Check : Ensure a file named assignments.csv is created in the root directory upon adding the first assignment, and that it is deleted or empty upon a fresh start with no assignments.
2. Functional Testing Scenarios :
a. Functional Testing Modules - Add and View, Update, Persistence
b. Reporting - Filtering, Priority View
3. Validation and Error Handling :
a. Invalid Date
b. Non-Numeric Score
c. Invalid Menu Choice
